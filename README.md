# spotify-challenge

## What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?

	It's an easy way for someone to test their knowledge of the songs they own or songs in general.

	To start, click Featured Playlist or Your Playlist after logging in. Then click on the big spotify logo to play the song snippet. Currently the answers show up on the left of input box because they have to match exactly (not case sensitive). You get a green checkmark if you got it right and red x if you got it wrong
